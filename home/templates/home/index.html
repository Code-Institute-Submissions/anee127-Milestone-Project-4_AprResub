                    Take time out from everyday life to learn a new craft, rekindle an old one or simply relax with friends and other like-minded people. A few hours of escape and the opportunity to recharge â€“ as well as the chance to learn or develop a creative skill.
                    Our events are hosted both online and in cafes, pubs, community centres and church halls around the South West London area. We run them during the daytime, weekends and evenings, making our classes accessible to everyone, whatever your lifestyle. 
                    Do feel free to contact us anytime to suggest ideas, offer yourself as a teacher, or simply for more information.
